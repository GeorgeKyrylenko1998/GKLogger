# GKLogger

**GKLogger** is a Swift-based logging utility designed to manage application logs efficiently using CoreData. It allows logging of messages with different severity levels (Debug, Info, Warning, and Error) and supports exporting logs as plain text files. GKLogger ensures logs are persistent and retrievable even after the application restarts.

## Features

- **Logging Levels**: Supports multiple log levels: `.debug`, `.info`, `.warning`, `.error`.
- **CoreData Integration**: Stores logs in CoreData with a managed object model (`GKLogs`).
- **Log Exporting**: Fetches and exports logs to a `.txt` file.
- **Concurrency Support**: Logging operations are performed on background threads for performance.
- **Customizable Log Limit**: Allows setting the limit on the number of logs fetched.
- **OSLog Integration**: Integrates with Apple's `OSLog` for system logging.

  ### Installation Instructions for GKLogger via Swift Package Manager (SPM)

You can add **GKLogger** to your project using Swift Package Manager (SPM) by following these steps:

### Step 1: Add GKLogger as a Package Dependency

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Select your project in the Xcode project navigator.
3. In the project editor, select the **Package Dependencies** tab.
4. Click the **+** button at the bottom of the list of packages.
5. In the dialog that appears, enter the repository URL:

```
https://github.com/GeorgeKyrylenko1998/GKLogger
```

6. Choose the version or branch you want to use:
   - Use the **Up to Next Major Version** rule if you want to receive updates that donâ€™t include breaking changes.
   - Use **Exact Version** if you want a specific version.
   - You can also choose a specific branch, such as `main`.

7. Click **Add Package**.

## Usage

### Logging Messages

Log messages using various log levels:

```swift
GKLogger.log("This is a debug message", type: .debug)
GKLogger.log("An error occurred while saving", type: .error)
```

### Retrieving Logs as Data

You can retrieve stored logs as a `Data` object in UTF-8 format:

```swift
if let logsData = GKLogger.logsData {
    // Use the logsData here, e.g., save to a file or upload
}
```

You can also set the maximum number of logs to be retrieved by adjusting `logsLimit`:

```swift
GKLogger.logsLimit = 10000
```

### Exporting Logs to File

You can export logs as a `.txt` file:

```swift
GKLogger.logsURL { fileURL in
    guard let fileURL = fileURL else { return }
    // Use the file URL to share or save the file
}
```

### Configuring Log Levels

By default, the log level is set to `.debug`. You can adjust the log level, so only messages at or above the specified level will be logged.

```swift
GKLogger.logLevel = .warning
```

In this example, only messages of level `.warning` and higher (e.g., `.error`) will be logged.
